                            The ORB is an experimental crypto game that will continue to be developed over time.
                            <br />The uniqueness of the game is its explosive APY farm rates and the rules that govern them.
                            <br />It enables players to gain large returns on their initial investments.
                            <br />The project will be continually developed over time.
                            <br />The generated liquidity is supplied to PancakeSwap and cannot be interacted with by the Team.
                            <br />The game will last for 7 days only, plan accordingly.
